#Smart Polluion Under Control (SPUC)
There is a lot of pollution in this country. Presently, we are using ‘vehicles’ (PCU Vans) to check the pollution values of other vehicles! Isn’t that sort of an irony? So, we thought of coming up with a Smart Idea. Our idea would use digital CO detectors, which would send values (in ppm) to our android application. The application will continuously update a central database hosted by the RTO (developed by us). As soon as the database encounters a value for a vehicle where CO levels have crossed the threshold value, a notification will be sent automatically to that vehicle’s owner along with a deadline date. Also, if the owner doesn’t get his vehicle serviced, a notice of a fine will be sent to his address. We came up with one more thought. Presently, a traffic policeman catches a vehicle and checks its PUC Sticker. But now, he can just ask the owner to show the status of his Pollution Emissions in the application. For viewing the statistics and other details in the central database, we have developed a Web Page which displays them.
